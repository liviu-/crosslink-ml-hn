# crosslink-ml-hn

## Overview

Reddit bot to link from /r/machinelearning submissions to HN discussions for same URL submissions to encourage more discussion/engagement between communities.


## To-do

I may or may not add any of these, but just to write down some potential improvements:
- [ ] Crosslink with /r/statistics and other subreddits
- [ ] Crosslink from HN (do they even allow bots?)
