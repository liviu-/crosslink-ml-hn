# crosslink-ml-hn

## Overview

Reddit bot to link from [/r/machinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) submissions to [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) discussions for same URL submissions to encourage more discussion/engagement between communities.


## To-do

I may or may not add any of these, but just to write down some potential improvements:
- [ ] Crosslink with /r/statistics and other subreddits
- [ ] Crosslink from HN (do they even allow bots?)
- [ ] Normalise URLs before checking similarity
- [x] Only link if HN submission has over `x` number of comments
- [x] Check older HN submissions too
